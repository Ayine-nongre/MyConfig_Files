# Neovim config ðŸ”¥
This folder contains configurations for my neovim working environment

## Requirements
You'll need neovim installed to use these settings

## How to set up the config
First clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Ayine-nongre/MyConfig_Files.git
```

Next change the directory to nvim_config

```
cd nvim_config
```

Create your nvim config folder in your home directory

```
mkdir p ~/.config/nvim
```

Move the init.vim file to the nvim config folder you created
```
mv init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```
After following these steps open neovim and enjoy a much easier to use vim-based editor :blush:
Enjoy ðŸ¥‚
